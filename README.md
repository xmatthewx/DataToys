Froebel’s Gifts introduced new forms of learning; Data Toys playfully present data in order to help us think systemically. News is primarily presented through stories, which may mask the complexity of the world. Data Toys introduce systems-based ways to make sense of raw data—the measured outputs of systems—through play.


## MPI: Making it in America, The Immigrant Success Index
Immigrants hace been the engine of growth for the US since its founding as a nation. But that engine may be stalling after years of bitter debate over how to treat immigrants.
The Immigrant Success Index aims to add hard facts and aha's to the public debate about immigrants and immigration reform. Today's debate and media coverage frames ussues as 'us' versus 'them', as legal versus illegal, and as faceless people versus neighbors, friends and colleagues. The political climate is opening now for a richer discussion and we want to enrich the debate. We plan to do that by telling personal stories about immigrant life here and uncovering the cities where immigrants are more likely to succeed and what policies, services and factors help or hurt them.

### DataBase
 [Here](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/DataToys/tree/master/MPI_DataBase) you can found all the databases previously clean for you.
 Don't for get to read [this overview](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/DataToys/blob/master/MPI_DataBase/data_overview.pdf?raw=true) it will help you to understand.
 
 You will two openFrameworks projects:
 
### DataVisualizer Basic
This is a simple example how to extract basic information from the dataBase. Then it's up to you to make great work with it.
For reading the .csv files you will need to download [Paul's Vollmer ofxCsv oF addon](https://github.com/WrongEntertainment/ofxCsv)

### DataVisualizer Comp
This is a little more complex example that gives you an idea to how compear and explore on the database for patterns by making comparisons.

### GeoDataLocalizator
This is another super simple example of how to put data on the map. Just a starting point to help you in context the data.
For it we are using [ModestMap](http://modestmaps.com/) thanks to [Tom Carden project for OF](https://github.com/RandomEtc/modestmaps-of)
